# I'm **James Jang**. An avid gamer and game programmer. Always striving to learn new techniques and finding ways to implement clean code.

## Background
I am a game programmer based in Gyeonggi-do(경기도), South Korea. I am currently employed by Smilegate Entertainment working on the CrossFire IP. I am a Canadian that graduated from George Brown College with a game programming degree and have been working in South Korea since 2017.
<br>
<br>
As a game programmer, I have a love for games. I have been playing games since I was 10 years old and have never stopped being in love with games. I always try to understand how gameplay mechanics were made and try to break it down in order to implement some ideas into my style of programming and designs.
