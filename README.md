# I'm **James Jang**. An avid gamer and game programmer. Always striving to learn new techniques and finding ways to implement clean code.

## Background
I am a game programmer based in Gyeonggi-do(경기도), South Korea. I am currently employed by Smilegate Entertainment working on the CrossFire IP. I am a Canadian that graduated from George Brown College with a game programming degree and have been working in South Korea since 2017.

<br>
As a game programmer, I have a love for games. I have been playing games since I was 10 years old and have never stopped being in love with games. I always try to understand how gameplay mechanics were made and try to break it down in order to implement some ideas into my style of programming and designs.

A game created by Ruckus Games. I was employed here during my semester as an intern. I worked on procedurally generating this mobile world using **C#** with the **Unity3D** Engine. I was tasked with fixing bugs as well as helping create character controls. This game was featured at an indie showcase at GDC but did not make it further than initial launch and was since taken down. 

## Pureblink Interactive Application

I created a sales app with **C++** using **Unreal Engine 4**. The purpose of this app was to display blueprints of apartments and create an atomsphere where potential customers can feel using digital renderings of future condominum projects. I created the architecture of this project. We got the information from a webserver and made it load onto our template during run time. This had to be done on runtime to give accurate pricing and availability information. 

## A.V.A: The Rise of Shayka

This was my first major proejct on mobile since starting my career as a game programmer. I learned a lot from this project by doing various tasks such as fixing bugs, creating tools for mobiles and, learning from my seniors. I focused on UI and PvP battles as well as social network intergration. This was my first time doing multiplayer programming and have learned a lot since then.
